# Data Structures and Algorithm with Design and Analysis
<p style = "font-size = 15px;">In this repository as you can guess from the title itself it will contain all the Data structure Algorithms and their Design and Analysis. So if you can contribute‚ù§ it would be great!ü§© </p>

<h3>What is Time Complexity?</h3>
It is just a mathematical way of analysing how long an algorithm with a given number of inputs (n) will take to complete it's task. It's usually defined using Big-O-notation. Now Big-O-Notation is a way of converting the overall steps of an algorithm term, then excluding lower order constants and coefficients that don't have that big impact on the orverall complexity of the problem.Below are some common time complexities with simple definitions. Feel free to check out Wikipedia, though, for more in-depth definitions. <br><br>
<ul>
<li>O(1) ‚Äî Constant Time: Given an input of size n, it only takes a single step for the algorithm to accomplish the task. It only takes a single step for the algorithm to accomplish the task.</li>
<li>O(log n) ‚Äî Logarithmic time: given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish the task are decreased by some factor with each step. The number of steps it takes to accomplish a task are decreased by some factor with each step.</li>
<li>O(n) ‚Äî Linear Time: Given an input of size n, the number of of steps required is directly related (1 to 1)</li>
<li>O(n¬≤) ‚Äî Quadratic Time: Given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is square of n.</li>
<li>O(C^n) ‚Äî Exponential Time: Given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is a constant to the n power (pretty large number).</li>
</ul>
